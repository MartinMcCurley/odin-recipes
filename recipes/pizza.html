    <h2>Description</h2>
    <a>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
        base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
        various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then
        baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
        pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.</a>
